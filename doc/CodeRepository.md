#### Code Repository

##### GitHub

> We will be using Github to host our private code repository for the project. The repository will simply be named Saturn. Members of the team and the project coordinator are all named as collaborators for the project and they can access the project by logging into GitHub. GitHub will allow us to manage multiple branches of code and keep the team organized, by providing a place to post documentation for the project.
